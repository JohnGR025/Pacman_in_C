LOG:
WHEN I TRY TO DIE AND THE GHOST IS ONE TILE A WAY AND GUARANTEED TO HIT ME, THE GAME WILL CRASH.
THE CHASE SEQUENCE DOES'NT WORK.

IN THIS FILE I AM SPECIFYING HOW THE CODE OF PACMAN.EXE WORKS.
 
 FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE THE FUNCTIONS.
 FUNCTIONS FOR DISPLAYING THE BOARD, MOVING THE CHARACTERS AND CHECKING THE BIAS OF PACMAN.
 
 AREA:
 DISPLAYING THE BOARD ACCORDING TO THE VALUES:
 O: OPEN SPACE
 B: BLOCK/WALL
 G: GHOST
 P: PACMAN
 
 PREPARING AREA:
 RANDOMIZE THE STARTING POSITION OF THE GHOSTS. THE STARTING POSITION OF PACMAN IS FIXED.
 
 MOVE PACMAN:
 PRESS A,S,D,W TO CHOOSE A DIRECTION. THE GAME WAITS UNTIL A KEY IS PRESSED. WE DON'T ACCEPT WRONG KEYS.
 CHECKING FOR OBSTACLES AND IF THE MOVEMENT IS UNSUCCESFUL THE TURN CHANGES MEANING GHOSTS GET TO MOVE INSTEAD.
 
 MOVE GHOSTS:
 FIRST IF THE GHOSTS IN TURN ARE IN THE SAME ROW OR COLM AS THE PACMAN THEN THEY WILL START TO CHASE.
 MEANING THEY WILL ONLY MOVE TOWARDS PACMAN FOR THAT TURN.
 IN ANY OTHER SITUATION, THEY WILL MOVE RANDOMLY.
 FIRST, IT IS BEEN DETIREMEND IF THE GHOST WILL MOVE OR NOT.
 THEN, WE GET WHICH DIRECTION IT WILL GO.
 BEFORE WE ACCEPT THE MOVEMENTS, WE ENSURE THAT THEY ARE DOABLE.

 ALIVE:
 CHECKS IF PACMAN GOT CLAPPED BY ANY GHOST (IF BOTH COORDINATIONS ARE EQUAL)

TIME FOR THE MAIN FUNCTION:
WE ARE STARTING WITH A SMALL MENU. WE GOT THE SETTINGS WHICH IS FOR CHANGING THE DIFFICULTY (MORE GHOST AND FRUITS, SCALES WITH DIFFICULTY)
NEXT WE ARE PREPARING THE BOARD RANDOMISING THE POSITIONS OF OUR ENTITIES.
WHEN THE GAME STARTS WE CHOOSE TO MOVE. IF 'q' IS PRESSED OR PACMAN GETS KILLED THEN THE PROGRAM RETURNS TO MENU.
ELSE, WE CHECK THE MOVEMENT, IF ACCEPTABLE THE GHOST START TO MOVE.
WHEN THE ROUND IS FINISHED WE DISPLAY MESSAGES.
