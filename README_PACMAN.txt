IN THIS FILE I AM SPECIFYING HOW THE CODE OF PACMAN.EXE WORKS.

FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE THE FUNCTIONS.
FUNCTIONS FOR DISPLAYING THE BOARD, MOVING THE CHARACTERS AND CHECKING THE BIAS OF PACMAN.

AREA:
DISPLAYING THE BOARD ACCORDING TO THE VALUES:
O: OPEN SPACE
B: BLOCK/WALL
G: GHOST
P: PACMAN

PREPARING AREA:
RANDOMIZE THE STARTING POSITION OF THE GHOSTS. THE STARTING POSITION OF PACMAN IS FIXED.

MOVE PACMAN:
PRESS A,S,D,W TO CHOOSE A DIRECTION. THE GAME WAITS UNTIL A KEY IS PRESSED. WE DON'T ACCEPT WRONG KEYS.
CHECKING FOR OBSTACLES AND IF THE MOVEMENT IS UNSUCCESFUL THE TURN CHANGES MEANING GHOSTS GET TO MOVE INSTEAD.

MOVE GHOSTS:
FIRST IF THE GHOSTS IN TURN ARE IN THE SAME ROW OR COLM AS THE PACMAN THEN THEY WILL START TO CHASE.
MEANING THEY WILL ONLY MOVE TOWARDS PACMAN FOR THAT TURN.
IN ANY OTHER SITUATION, THEY WILL MOVE RANDOMLY.
